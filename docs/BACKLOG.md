# Backlog

Written down rather than carried in anyone's head. Each item has the
measurement that justifies it, so the next person does not re-derive it.

Opened 2026-10-14, at the close of the ThreatFox / intel-collector /
brand-rule pass.

---

## 1. Brand-rule replacement

**State:** signal disabled (`BRAND_REFERENCE_SIGNAL_ENABLED`, default off).
Nothing is scored on it. The replacement is not built.

**Why it is not just "fix the ownership test":** the test is inverted in its
*use*. `paypal-secure-login-update-account.xyz` contains "paypal", so the old
rule concluded PayPal owned it and skipped — while *"contains the brand word
and isn't the brand's"* is the detection worth having. The condition used to
exclude is the condition that should include.

**Order, decided on the measurements:**

1. **Rendered text or form action, not the raw body.** The only option
   needing no list at all, and it removes two-thirds of the signal outright:
   984 of 1,085 Google flags co-occur with a Google/gstatic external
   resource, i.e. they are `<script src>` hits.
2. **Split "mentions a brand" from "imitates a brand".** One field currently
   carries two claims and only one is a detection. Do this regardless of (1).
3. **Ownership from evidence already collected** — `hosting.asn_org` reads
   `Microsoft Corporation` for `live.com`; TLS SANs; WHOIS registrant — with
   a mandatory third state. Anything behind a CDN reads `Cloudflare`, so "no
   evidence of ownership" must mean **unknown**, never *not-owned*, or the
   same inversion returns wearing better evidence.

**Constraint:** it must not be a ninth hand-maintained list.
`test_brand_reference_signal.py` fails if a `BRAND_OWNERS` or
`OWNED_DOMAINS` list appears.

Evidence: `docs/problems/the-brand-rule-flags-the-brand.md`.

## 2. VirusTotal rate-limit clustering

**Measured:** 201 of 2,218 runs (9.1%) failed with "rate limit exceeded on
all configured keys". They occupy **20 of 431 active hours**, and 199 fall on
2026-09-15 and 2026-09-16 — the two busiest days in the 90-day window, at
2.2× and 2.8× the third-busiest. Whole hours are total losses: 21/21, 20/20,
18/18, 17/17, 15/15.

**Why it matters:** `vt_malicious >= 5` leads the escalation clause.
VirusTotal is the heaviest term in the ladder and the one most likely to be
absent when volume is highest, so anyone able to generate volume degrades the
platform's primary enrichment as a side effect.

**Cost measured:** 201 extra `suspicious / investigate` verdicts on the two
busiest days — analyst load, not missed detections, because
`observable_clean` requires `vt_found`.

**Open decisions, neither taken:**
- should the answer-rate denominator exclude collector failures? Today
  `virustotal` reads 100% answered with 203 collector-failed beside it;
- should a run that lost VirusTotal be re-queued rather than concluded? 201
  cases were decided on a partial evidence set and recorded as finished.

**Status:** dormant since 2026-09-17. Load-dependent, so it recurs at the
next burst and nothing fires during one.

Evidence: `docs/problems/virustotal-fails-when-volume-peaks.md`.

## 3. The Pydantic-default five

**Measured:** 198 distinct field names across 68 models default to an empty
container, which makes "found nothing" and "nobody looked" the same bytes
before the data reaches storage. **That list is not the work list** — most are
outputs where empty genuinely means none produced.

The criterion: *an emptiness that claims an external source answered, read
where absence grants leniency.* That gives **four**, after the ANY.RUN grain
split removed one:

| source | read as | the "was it asked" record | consumed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| phishtank | `not phishtank_positive` | in `feeds_checked`, 98.3% of rows | **no** |
| openphish | `not openphish_listed` | in `feeds_checked`, 98.3% | **no** |
| urlscan | `not urlscan_malicious` | `urlscan.meta.status`, 98.3% completed | **no** |
| http signals | `not high_conf_http` | `http.reachable` 84.1%, `meta.status` 97.9% | **no** |

For all four the flag **already exists and nothing reads it** — the same
finding as ThreatFox and the intel collector. The fix is consuming a field
that is already written, not new plumbing.

Pattern to apply: the Google Safe Browsing shape (`checked and not listed`),
or `None` plus a named `Absent`. **Do not** convert 198 defaults.

Evidence: `docs/problems/container-defaults-erase-absence.md`.

---

## 4. The change-detection limb for the answer-rate check

**Why:** an absolute floor cannot catch a decline. `intel_blocklists` went
21.5% → 0 and `threatfox` 11.7% → 0 without crossing any threshold, and
`otx` currently reads **23.3%** — a partial failure no floor will flag.

**What exists:** `source_answer_rate_service` now reports `never_answered`,
`never_asked`, `never_present` and `collectors_not_covered`. All four are
absolute.

**What is missing:** a comparison against the source's own recent history, so
a source halving is a finding even while it still answers. The shadow-first
rule applies — report before alarming, and take the threshold from a week of
the check's own output rather than picking one.

---

## 5. The three outbound documents

In `docs/outbound/`, each with a named owner and **no channel to send it**.
This platform has no outbound mechanism, so they need carrying by hand.

| document | to | ask |
|---|---|---|
| `grupobiopar-now-listed.md` | SOC analyst on duty | look at the domain again; and decide whether a concluded verdict reopens when a feed lists its subject afterwards |
| `technique-disagreements.md` | detection-content owners | 488 ATT&CK disagreements |
| `silent-endpoints.md` | Wazuh / endpoint-agent owners | which of Tier A are decommissioned and which are broken |

Closing the gap itself — an outbound channel — is the larger item behind
these three.

---

## 6. Phase 3: cross-case pivots

Parked since the watch-task work. **The `ioc_values` ceiling is still
unscoped** — case membership via `ioc_values` was the fourth tautological
discriminator found here, so any pivot built on it inherits that problem
until the ceiling is measured.

Nothing should be built on cross-case `ioc_values` before that measurement.

---

## 7. Tenant scoping is exercised by nobody — before the second tenant

**Trigger condition, not a date: before a second real tenant is onboarded.**

All 28 users have `all_tenants = true` and `tenant_ids = []`. Tenant scoping
exists in the schema, has a service (`app/services/tenant_scope.py`), is
applied by every alert-run read and every integrations read — and no
principal is actually restricted by it.

Today that is harmless: there is one tenant, so an unfiltered query and a
filtered one return the same rows. **The day a second tenant exists, every
one of those 28 accounts can see it**, and nothing in the system will say so
because no test and no user exercises the restriction.

What closing it means: at least one real principal with
`all_tenants = false` and a non-empty `tenant_ids`, reading the product
through the UI. Until then the only thing standing between the design and a
cross-tenant read is
`backend/tests/unit/test_security/test_integration_isolation.py`, which
constructs a restricted principal precisely because nothing else does.

---

## 8. No credential in this system has an expiry check

**From the Spamhaus forensics, 2026-10-14.** The stored
`SPAMHAUS_SIA_TOKEN` is a JWT whose `exp` claim decodes to
**2026-05-12T11:23:24Z** — the same day the SIA step was committed. The
collector then failed on 2,198 consecutive runs for 98 days.

The expiry was **in the token, in the database, readable, and nothing read
it.** Same shape as `meta.status`, `feeds_skipped` and `sources_checked`: the
information was there and no consumer existed.

**Partly done, 2026-10-14.** `app/services/credential_expiry_service.py` is
the central register the Falcon integration reports its OAuth token expiry
to. What remains is every *other* credential this platform holds —
`.env`-based provider keys with no expiry visible, and the Spamhaus SIA token
itself, which is still expired.

**Natural home:** `source_answer_rate_service`, which already distinguishes
*never answered* from *never asked* from *never present*. An expired
credential is a fourth category and the one that is fixable before it bites —
a JWT's `exp` is readable without calling the provider, so this costs one
decode per configured credential and no requests.

Scope: every credential this platform holds that carries a decodable expiry.
Report, do not alarm, and do not log any part of a credential.

Evidence: the addendum in
`docs/problems/the-intel-collector-was-dead-for-98-days.md`.

## 9. Falcon ingest, and what it brings with it

Enrichment shipped 2026-10-14. Ingest did not, and deliberately:

* **`_create_alert_run` must be extracted** from
  `app/api/alert_investigations.py` into a service first. Five endpoints
  funnel through it, it is a private function in an API module, and a Celery
  poller would be a sixth caller importing from the API layer.
* **A Falcon field map**, where unmapped fields are quarantined as
  `no_field_map` and never inferred.
* **Falcon's MITRE attributions are a third technique namer** and must not
  quietly join `rule_only`.
* **The tenant does not reach an investigation yet** — see
  `docs/design/integrations.md`. `spawn_investigation` accepts it;
  `alert_body_investigation_service` never sees it.
* And **the Alerts API accepts unknown FQL field names silently** (measured:
  twelve fields including an invented one, all HTTP 200 with zero
  resources). A wrong field reads as "the EDR has nothing" for ever. The
  answer-rate registration is the backstop, not the fix.

---

## Closed in this pass, recorded so they are not reopened

* **ThreatFox** — off. Measured benefit over seven months: **zero verdicts
  changed**; 25 of 25 knowable positives were already caught by other
  sources. Measured cost within two hours of the credential being restored:
  two `malicious/high/90/block` verdicts on Microsoft apexes. The query is a
  substring search, so granularity could not fix it.
* **The brand rule** — off, and the close is clean: **disabling cost zero
  detections** and fixed five false `malicious/82` verdicts
  (`googlebot.com`, `www.google.com/bot.html`,
  `www.apple.com/go/applebot`, a MITRE technique page, `otar.nl`). The
  control row is what makes the 833 a measurement rather than a number:
  **0 of 779 non-carriers moved.**
* **The intel collector** — 98 days dead from one unguarded credential call;
  guarded, with per-source `sources_checked`/`sources_skipped`.
* **Per-tenant integrations, enrichment** — tenant-keyed, five-state status
  derived rather than flagged, secrets encrypted and write-only with a
  rotation path, catalogue derived from the connectors, and CrowdStrike
  Falcon `verified_ok` against the live API. See
  `docs/design/integrations.md`.
* **Spamhaus** — not a credential problem. `login realm=intel` returns
  *"no subscriptions found"*; the ask is a **DQS** key, which also fixes the
  SURBL/DBL public-resolver refusals. An SIA subscription would only restore
  a field nothing reads.
